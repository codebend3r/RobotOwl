  "readme": "# gulp-build\n\nGulp 3 plugin for building out files for deployment. Good for swapping environmental variables like Google Analytics IDs, or just compiling static HTML files.\n\n`gulp-build` uses HandleBars for templates, and supports partials and layouts.\n\n**Version `0.5.0` was a big update. I moved away from using Underscore templates, and have added support for partials and layouts. Both partials and layouts must be passed in as strings, but a future update will bring support for file glob'ing.**\n\n## Install\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save-dev gulp-build\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nBasic usage:\n\n```javascript\nvar build = require('gulp-build');\n\ngulp.task('build', function() {\n  gulp.src('scripts/*.js')\n      .pipe(build({ GA_ID: '123456' }))\n      .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'))\n});\n```\n\nWith partials and a layout:\n\n```javascript\nvar build = require('gulp-build');\n\nvar options = {\n\tpartials: [{\n\t\tname: 'footer',\n\t\ttpl: '<p>Copyright 2013</p>'\n\t}],\n\tlayout: '<html><body>{{> body}}</body></html>'\n};\n\ngulp.task('build', function() {\n  gulp.src('pages/*.html')\n      .pipe(build({ title: 'Some page' }, options))\n      .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'))\n});\n\n```\n\nIf your templates want to render partials, you just reference them as: `{{> partialName}}`.\n\nIf you use a layout, you need the `{{> body}}` tag for the plugin to know where to place your content. If you omit it, your compiled file will be missing the main content!\n\n\n## API\n\n### gulp-build(data, config)\n\n#### data\nTemplates vars passed down to `HandleBars` for compiling\n\n#### config.layout\nType: `String`<br />\nDefault: null\n\n#### config.partials\nType: `Array` containing `Objects`<br />\nDefault: []\n\nA config object with partials would look like:\n\n```javascript\nvar options = {\n  partials: [\n    { name: 'footer', tpl: '<p>Copyright 2014</p>' },\n    { name: 'header', tpl: '<h1>The Header!</h1>' }\n  ]\n};\n```\n\nYour template could use those partials by using: `{{> footer}}` or `{{> header}}`\n\n## Testing\n\nOpen a terminal in the directory containing `gulp-build` and then:\n\n```shell\nnpm install\nnpm test\n```\n\n## The License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2014 TJ Eastmond\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
